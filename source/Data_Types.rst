NoneType
========

The **sole** value of the type NoneType is ``None``. 
The **None** value represent something which is *unknown*, *undefined*, 
None is also frequently used to represent the absence of a value as when default arguments are not passed to a function. ::
   
   >>> print type(None)
   <type 'NoneType'>
   >>> a = None
   >>> b = None
   >>> id(a)
   9568656
   >>> id(b)
   9568656 

 ..note:: 
   the id() function returns an integer representing its identity (currently implemented as its address). 
   so if 2 objects have the same id it's the same object.

The None value is convert in boolean (see below) to False.::
   >>> bool(None)
   False

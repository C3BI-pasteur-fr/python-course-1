What is pep 8
=============

Py.thon Enhancement Proposal 8
This document gives coding **conventions** for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution.

A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is most important.

Some good reasons to ignore a particular guideline:

* When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP.
* To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for historic reasons) -- although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else's mess (in true XP style).
* Because the code in question predates the introduction of the guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying that code.
* When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of Python that don't support the feature recommended by the style guide.


Why is pep 8
============

code is read much more often than it is written. 
The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code.
As PEP 20 says, "**Readability counts**".

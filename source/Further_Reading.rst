**Programming in Python 3**
   *Mark Summerfield*, (addison wesley): http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book.html
   
   This book cover only Python 3. It is focused on the language,
   But the concepts of Python are clearly exposed and 
   after reading it every thing in the language make sense.
   Lot of parts of this course come from this book.
   I highly recommand it.   
   
**Think Python, How to Think Like a Computer Scientist**
    *Allen B. Downey* http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/
    
    This is an open source book, so you can get it freely. It use Pyhton2 syntax.
    The analyse of the concept of the language are not so accute that in *Programming in Python 3*
    But it is focused to learn python by example to scientific people (but ther is no bioinformatics example)
    It's a good book for people who are not a daily programmer and want to use python as script language.     
    
**Managing Your Biological Data with Python**
   *Allegra Via, Kritian Rother, Anna Tramontano* (Chapman and Hall/CRC): http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439880937
   
   This book is specially focused on bioinformatics. You will not become a developper after reading the book
   as it is not focused on the mechanism of the language. But there lot of reciepes only focused on bioinformtics .
   It even in the using *biopython* library or scripting *pymmol*. 
   This is a practical manual that will help you every day to solve your bioinformatics problems.

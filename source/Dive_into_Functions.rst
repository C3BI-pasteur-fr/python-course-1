Dive into Functions
===================

Functions are a way to package functionalities. There are 4 kind of functions in Python:

* global functions
* local functions
* lambda functions
* methods 

*Global* functions are created with the keyword *def* and take a name and an optional list of parameters. 
They are accessible to any code in the same module in which it is created. 
They can also be accessible from other modules with a mechanism of import.

*Local* are created as globals functions but defined inside other functions (also called *nested* functions). 
These functions are visible only to the function where they are defined.

*Lambda* functions are expressions, so they can be created at their point of use. 
however they are much more limited than normal functions.

*Methods* are functions that are bound to a particular data type and can be used only in conjunction with this data type.

global functions, local functions and method are created with the keyword def and return a value. 
To return a value we explicitly use the keyword ``return`` if we do not do that ``None`` is return automatically by python.
We can leave a function at any point by using the ``return`` statement (the yield can be used also but will not cover here). 
We can call functions by appending parenthesis to the function name. ::

   >>> def global_func():
         return "global_func is a global function"
 
   >>> print global_func()
      "global_func is a global function"

Names and Docstrings
--------------------
 
see :ref:`names_and_docstrings`


functions are objects
---------------------

see :ref:`func_are_obj`

    
nested functions
----------------

It is useful to have helper function inside a function. 
To do this we simply define a function inside the definition of an existing function. 
Such function are often called *nested* functions or *locals* functions. ::

   def outer():
       x = 1
       def inner():
           return 2
       return x + inner()
    
   outer()
   3


function argument vs parameters
-------------------------------

These two terms *parameter* and *argument* are sometimes loosely used interchangeably, 
and the context is used to distinguish the meaning. 
The term *parameter* (sometimes called *formal parameter*) is often used to refer to the variable as found in the function definition, 
while *argument* (sometimes called *actual parameter*) refers to the actual value passed. 
To avoid confusion, it is common to view a parameter as a variable, and an argument as a value. 
Python allow us to pass arguments to functions.
The parameter names become local variable of our function [parameters_and_arguments]_. 
If there is more parameters than one, they are written as a sequence of comma separated identifiers, 
or as sequence of identifier = value pair. 
For instance, here is a function that calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula: ::

   def heron(a, b, c):
      s = (a + b + c) / 2
      return math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

Inside the function each parameter, *a*, *b*, *c*, is initialized with the corresponding value that was passed as an argument. 
When the function is called, we must supply all arguments, for example, heron(3, 4, 5).
If we give too few or too many arguments, a ``TypeError exception`` will be raised. 

When we do a call like this we said to be using a positional arguments, 
because each argument passed is set as the value of parameter in the corresponding position. 
So in this case, *a* is set to 3, *b* to 4, and *c* to 5, when the function is called.

Some functions have parameters for which there can be sensible default.

.. _arguments_n_parameters:

Arguments and Parameters
------------------------

Python has different ways to define function parameters and pass arguments to them. Function parameters can be either

* positional parameters that are mandatory or named,
* keyword parameters that provide a default value. 

The parameter syntax does not permit us to follow parameters with default value with parameters that don't have default value. 
So def bad(a, b = 1, c) wont work. 
We are not force to pass our arguments in the order they appear in the function's definition, instead, 
we can use keyword arguments, passing each argument in the form name = value. ::

   def argument(a, b, c = 3, d = 4):
      print '{} {} {} {}'.format(a,b,c,d)
 
   argument(1,2)
   1 2 3 4
 
   argument(a = 1, b = 2)
   1 2 3 4
 
   argument(b = 2, a = 1)
   1 2 3 4

.. warning::    
   
   When default values are given they are created at the time of the *def* statement is executed (i.e. when the function is created), 
   **not** when the function is called. For immutable arguments like numbers or strings this doesn't make any difference,
   but for mutable arguments a subtle trap is lurking. ::

      def app(x, lst = []):
          #id print the memory adress of the object
          print( id(lst) )
          lst.append(x)
          return lst
       
      #the default value of the function app is an empty list 
      app.func_defaults
       ([],)
       
       
      app(1)
       #the memory adress of lst is 21665048
       21665048
      [1]
       
      app.func_defaults
      ([1],) 
      # now the default value of the app function is list [1] 
      # the first call to app have a side effect
       
      app(2)
       # the memory adress does not change (this is the same object than at the first call
       # the list was created at app function create time.
       21665048
      [1, 2]
       
      app.func_defaults
      ([1, 2],)

   Here at the list lst was created at function creation time, 
   at each call Python reuse the same list to add new element. 
   This induce a big and dangerous side effect, and usually it's not the desired behavior. 
   Here a new version without side effect: ::

      def app(x, lst = None):
         if lst is None:
           lst = []
         #id print the memory adress of the object
         print( id(lst) )
         lst.append(x)
         return lst
    
    
Variable number of parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A function can take additional optional arguments by prefixing the last parameter with an \* (asterix). Optional
arguments are then available in the tuple referenced by this parameter.
Optional variables can also by passed as keywords, if the last parameter is preceded by \*\*. In this case, the
optional variables are available within the function as a dictionary.
The operation consisting to get the arguments passed as sequence is call *argument unpacking*.
Let look how it work, especially there are significant differences between python 2 and 3. 



Sequence unpacking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can unpack any iterables (list, tuples, ...) with the operator \*.
When used with two or more variables on the left-hand side of an assignment,
one of which is preceded by \*, items are assigned to the variables,
with all those left over assigned to the stared variables. ::

    >>> first, *rest = [1,2,3,4]
    >>> first
    1
    >>> rest
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>>
    >>> first, *mid, last = [1,2,3,4]
    >>> first
    1
    >>> mid
    [2, 3]
    >>> last
    4

.. note::
    The unpacking operator does not exist in Python 2
         
Argument unpacking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scope of variables
------------------
 
For variables, Python has function scope, module scope, and global scope (in python the term of namespaces is often used) [Franklin]_. 
Names enter scope at the start of a context (function, module, or globally), 
and exit scope when a non-nested function is called or the context ends. 

If a name is used prior to variable initialization, this raises a ``syntax error``.


.. _variable_resolution_rules:

Variable resolution rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. 
At any time during execution, there are at least three nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:

#. the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names
#. the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-local, but also non-global names
#. the next-to-last scope contains the current moduleâ€™s global names
#. the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in name

If a variable is simply accessed (not assigned to) in a context, 
name resolution follows the LEGB rule (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in). 
However, if a variable is assigned to, it defaults to creating a local variable, 
which is in scope for the entire context. Both these rules can be overridden 
with a global or nonlocal (*nonlocal* does not exists in Python 2) declaration prior to use,
which allows accessing global variables even if there is an intervening nonlocal variable, 
and assigning to global or nonlocal variables [scope]_ .

         res = p + I - G
         return res

.. container::
         
   We first defined 2 objects references G and I which refer respectively to integers 4 and 12 
   then we create a new object reference func which refer to the function code 
   (I remember you that in Python everything is an object)

      y = func(3)
 
.. container::
         
   #. When we call the function func with argument 3, Python create a namespace local to the function, 
       with a first reference object "p" which refer to an integer object with the value 3.
   #. Then the code of the function is executed, a variable "I" is assigned to, so Python creates a new local reference.
   #. I show with small arrows how python resolve the variables to compute the statement
   #. then a reference "res" is created which point to the result of the statement "p + I - G"

      As the int object with 4 as value have another reference (y) it will not be destroyed.  
 
 
.. container:: clearer

   .. image :: _static/figs/spacer.png 
   
We can see this mechanism in action as in Python we can view the content of the local the global namespace 
via two built-in functions *locals* and *globals*

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

      def outer_func():
         x = 'outer'
         print('outer locals = ', locals())
         print(x)

         def inner_func():
            nonlocal x
            print('inner locals = ', locals())
            x = 'inner'
            print('inner locals = ', locals())
            print(x)

         inner_func()
         print('outer locals = ', locals())

      outer_func()

.. container::
   when we use the ``nonlocals`` keywords the variable find in the outer scope is seen as it belong to the local scope.
   We can manipulate it as a local variable.
   If we reassign a new value to this reference, the outer reference is also modified.


.. note::

   This piece of code illustrate the globals and locals namespaces. 
   Although this code is writen in python3 the concepts are the same in python2.
   But the keywords ``nonlocals`` is python3 specific.
   In python2, we can refer to a non local variable, but we cannot assign a new value to a non local variable, 
   when we try to assign a new value, a new local object reference is created.

Variable lifetime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Itâ€™s also important to note that not only do variables live inside a namespace, they also have lifetimes. Consider ::

   >>> def foo():
   ...     x = 1
   >>> foo()
   >>> print(x) # 1
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
   NameError: name 'x' is not defined
   
It isnâ€™t just scope rules at point #1 that cause a problem (although thatâ€™s why we have a NameError)
it also has to do with how function calls are implemented in Python and many other languages. 
There isnâ€™t any syntax we can use to get the value of the variable x at this point - it literally doesnâ€™t exist! 
The namespace created for our function *foo* is created from scratch each time the function is called and it is destroyed when the function ends [Franklin]_.


Lambda functions
----------------

In addition the def statement, Python also provides an expression form that generates function objects.
The lambdaâ€™s syntax is keyword *lambda*, followed by one or more arguments
(exactly like the arguments list you enclose in parentheses in a def header), followed by an expression after a colon:

| **lambda** argument1, argument2,... argumentN **:** expression using arguments

Function objects returned by running lambda expressions work exactly the same as those created and assigned by defs,
but there are a few differences that make lambdas useful in specialized roles:

* ``lambda`` is an expression, **not** a statement. Then a ``lambda`` can appear in places a ``def`` is not allowed by Pythonâ€™s syntax: 
  
  * inside a list literal 
  * or a function callâ€™s arguments, for example. As an expression, lambda returns a value (a new function)
    that can optionally be assigned a name. In contrast, the def statement always assigns the new function to the name in the header,
    instead of returning it as a result.

* ``lambda``â€™s body is a single expression, not a block of statements.
   The ``lambda``â€™s body is similar to what youâ€™d put in a ``def`` bodyâ€™s return statement;
   you simply type the result as a naked expression, instead of explicitly returning it.
   Because it is limited to an expression, a ``lambda`` is less general than a ``def`` you can only squeeze
   so much logic into a ``lambda`` body without using statements such as ``if``.
   This is by design, to limit program nesting: ``lambda`` is designed for coding simple functions, and ``def`` handles larger tasks.

Apart from those distinctions, defs and lambdas do the same sort of work: ::


   >>> def func(x, y, z): return x + y + z
   ...
   >>> func(2, 3, 4)
   9
   
   >>> f = lambda x, y, z: x + y + z
   >>> f(2, 3, 4)
   9
   
We can use default arguments or tuple or dict argument like \*args or \*\*kwargs exactly as in ``def`` functions.
The code in a ``lambda`` body also follows the same scope lookup rules (:ref:`LGEB <variable_resolution_rules>`) 
as code inside a def. lambda expressions introduce a local scope much like a nested def, 
which automatically sees names in enclosing functions, the module, and the built-in scope.


Why Use lambda?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generally speaking, lambdas come in handy as a sort of function shorthand that allows you to embed a functionâ€™s definition 
within the code that uses it. They are entirely optional (you can always use defs instead), 
but they tend to be simpler coding constructs in scenarios where you just need to embed small bits of executable code.

For instance, it will very often use in function that take a function as parameter, as ``sort``, ``filter``, ... ::

   from collections import namedtuple  
   Sequence = namedtuple("Sequence", "id comment sequence")
   sequences = [
      Sequence('abcd3_rat', '', 
               'MAAFSKYLTARNSSLAGAAFLLFCLLHKRRRALGLHGKKSGKPPLQNNEKEGKKERAVVDKVFLSRLSQILKI'),
      Sequence('il2_human_matured', 'matured sequence of il2_human', 
               'APTSSSTKKTQLQLEHLLLDLQMILNGINNYKNPKLTRMLTFKFYMPKKATELKHLQCLEEELKPLEEV'),
      Sequence('il2_human', '', 
               'MYRMQLLSCIALSLALVTNSAPTSSSTKKTQLQLEHLLLDLQMILNGINNYKNPKLTRMLTFKFYMPKKATELKHLQCLE'),
      Sequence('TRYP_PIG', '' , 
               'FPTDDDDKIVGGYTCAANSIPYQVSLNSGSHFCGGSLINSQWVVSAAHCYKSRIQVRLGE')]

   filter(lambda seq: seq.sequence.startswith('M'), sequences)

   [Sequence(id='il2_human', comment='', 
            sequence='MYRMQLLSCIALSLALVTNSAPTSSSTKKTQLQLEHLLLDLQMILNGINNYKNPKLTRMLTFKFYMPKKATELKHLQCLE'),
    Sequence(id='abcd3_rat', comment='', 
            sequence='MAAFSKYLTARNSSLAGAAFLLFCLLHKRRRALGLHGKKSGKPPLQNNEKEGKKERAVVDKVFLSRLSQILKIMVPRTFC')]

   sequences.sort(lambda seq1, seq2: len(seq2.sequence)- len(seq1.sequence))
   
   [ (seq.id, len(seq.sequence)) for seq in sequences]
   [('il2_human', 80), ('abcd3_rat', 73), ('il2_human_matured', 69), ('TRYP_PIG', 60)]
   
Without due care, they can lead to unreadable (a.k.a. obfuscated) Python code. 
In general, simple is better than complex, explicit is better than implicit, and full statements are better than arcane expressions.
Thatâ€™s why lambda is limited to expressions. If you have larger logic to code, use def; lambda is for small pieces of inline code. 
On the other hand, you may find these techniques useful in moderation.
